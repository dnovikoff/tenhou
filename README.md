[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dnovikoff/tenhou.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dnovikoff/tenhou)

golang package for working with tenhou net logs and protocol

This package contains functions for parsing/generating:
1. Log files
2. Client messages
3. Server messages

## Howto use proxy server
I've made this small proxy for researching tenhou.net flash client protocol content.

Download application
```
go get -u github.com/dnovikoff/tenhou/cmd/tenhou-proxy
```

Run application
```
$GOPATH/bin/tenhou-proxy
```

Add to your `hosts` file
```
127.0.0.1	b.mjv.jp
```

Login into flash client http://tenhou.net/0/ .
Application output would look like
```
2018/01/27 00:26:42 Started server on addr ':10080'. Sequence id is 'baab75ab'
2018/01/27 00:26:55 File for new connection is 'baab75ab_0001.log'

2018/01/27 00:26:57 File for new connection is 'baab75ab_0003.log'
```

Protocol logs will appear in workdir.

## pimbooo example server
Pimboo (Pin-Man-Bamboo) is a small example server for a game of two players.
The server is created in demonstration purposes only and does not aim for a production.

Download example server
```
go get -u github.com/dnovikoff/tenhou/cmd/pimboo-server
```

Run application
```
$GOPATH/bin/pimboo-server
```

Add to your `hosts` file
```
127.0.0.1	b.mjv.jp
```

1. Login into flash client http://tenhou.net/0/ .
2. Click on any lobby
3. See start of the game

![Example of game](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dnovikoff/tenhou/master/cmd/pimboo-server/example.gif)

The server suggests Ron on any opponent drop and Tsumo on any take.
If you call a Noten-agari, a Furiten-Ron or agari on a wrong tile, you will pay a penalty.

The game continues until one of the opponents will drop under zero points.
